# Modeling Your Code: Communicating Sequential Processes #
---

Concurrency is a property of the code; parallelism is a property of the running program.

Think about when you have only 1 core. We write concurrent code that we *hope* will be run in parallel.

The seminal paper that stands at the base of go's big concepts, namely the supplantation of OS threads with goroutines and the introduction of channels is called "Communicating Sequential Processes" (CSP) and is written by Tony Hoare.

### CSP ###

Input and output as primitives are often overlooked -  therefore CSP contained primitives to model input and output, or *communication*, between *processes* correctly (hence the name CSP).

process = portion of logic that takes input produces output consumed by another process (essentially a function but different times).

----
Hoarse created input and output commands:

- `!` for sending input into a process
- `?` for reading output from a process
- if the two refer to the same thing, the two processes would be said to *correspond*.

e.g. `cardreader?cardimage`, `lineprinter!lineimage`, `*[c:character;west?c -> east!c]`

Introduction of the *guarded command* (introduced by Dijkstra in 1974 in "Guarded commands, nondeterminancy and formal derivation of programs")
: `->`. Lefthand side is a conditional (*guard*) for the righthand side.

### Go's Philosophy on Concurrency ###

"Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating."

You have the ability to choose between CSP primitives vs memory acces synchronizations.
