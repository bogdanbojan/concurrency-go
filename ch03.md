# Go's Concurrency Building Blocks #

### Goroutines ###

A goroutine is a function that is running concurrently. Every program has at least one: `the main goroutine`.

Start it with the `go` keyword. Normal functions, anonymous ones and variable assigned functions can be started this way.

Goroutines are *not* 
- OS threads 
- green threads (managed by langugage's runtime)

- Goroutines are similar to coroutines. That is, concurrent subroutines(functions, closures, methods in Go) that are *nonpreemptive* - they cannot be interrupted. 

Coroutines have multiple points throughout which allow for suspension or reentry. Goroutines don't define their own suspension or reentry points! Go's runtime observes the runtime and automatically manages them. Thus, they are preemptable only when blocked.

*M:N scheduler* is the mechanism for Go's goroutines. M green threads to N OS threads. It follows the *fork-join* model of concurrency.
