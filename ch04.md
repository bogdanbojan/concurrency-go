# Concurrency Patterns in Go #

## Confinement ##

For safe operations, we have different options:

- synchronization primitives for sharing memory (e.g. `sync.Mutex`)
- synchronization via communicating (e.g. `channels`)

and

- immutable data
- data protected by confinement

---

Confinement can be of two types:
- ad hoc
- lexical

Adhoc confinement is hard to control.Maybe, it can be used if your team is actively using static analysis. In the example below, `data` is used only by the `loopData` function. 

```
data := make([]int, 4)

loopData := func(handleData chan<- int) {
    defer close(handleData)
    for i := range data {
        handleData <- data[i]
    }
}

handleData := make(chan int)
go loopData(handleData)

for num := range handleData {
    fmt.Println(num)
}
```

Lexical confinement involves using lexical scope to expose the correct data.

```
chanOwner := func() <-chan int {
    results := make(chan int, 5)
    go func() {
        defer close(results)
        for i := 0; i <= 5; i++ {
            results <- i
        }
    }()
    return results
}

consumer := func(results <-chan int) {
    for result := range results {
        fmt.Printf("Received: %d\n", result)
    }
    fmt.Println("Done receiving!")
}

results := chanOwner()
consumer(results)
```

## The for-select Loop ##

This is regular pattern in Go. It is usually used to:

- Sending iteration variables out on an channel
```
for _, s := range []string{"a", "b", "c"} {
    select {
    case <-done:
        return
    case stringStream <- s:
    }
}
```
- Looping infinitely waiting to be stopped
```
// Embedding the work in a `default` clause.
for {
    select {
    case <-done:
        return
    default:
    // Do non-preemptable work
    }
}

// Keeping the `select` statement as short as possible.
for {
    select {
    case <-done:
        return
    default:
    }
// Do non-preemptable work
}
```

## Preventing Goroutine Leaks ##

We don't want to have a goroutine that remains throughout the lifetime of the process by mistake. Like here:
```
doWork := func(strings <-chan string) <-chan interface{} {
    completed := make(chan interface{})
    go func() {
        defer fmt.Println("doWork exited.")
        defer close(completed)
        for s := range strings {
            // Do something interesting
            fmt.Println(s)
        }
    }()
    return completed
}

doWork(nil)
// Perhaps more work is done here
fmt.Println("Done.")
```

A way to mitigate this is to use a signal for the cancellation of the child goroutines through its parent. For example:

```
doWork := func(
    done <-chan interface{},
    strings <-chan string,
    ) <-chan interface{} {
        terminated := make(chan interface{})
        go func() {
            defer fmt.Println("doWork exited.")
            defer close(terminated)
            for {
                select {
                case s := <-strings:
                    fmt.Println(s)
                case <-done:
                    return
                }
            }
        }()
        return terminated
}

done := make(chan interface{})
terminated := doWork(done, nil)

go func() {
    // Cancel the operation after 1 second.
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Canceling doWork goroutine...")
    close(done)
}()

<-terminated
fmt.Println("Done.")
```
---

In the same vein, a goroutine can be blocked when attempting to write a value to a channel. Like here:

```
newRandStream := func() <-chan int {
    randStream := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        defer fmt.Println("newRandStream closure exited.") 
        defer close(randStream)
        for {
            randStream <- rand.Int()
        }
    }()

    return randStream
}

randStream := newRandStream()
fmt.Println("3 random ints:")
for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
    fmt.Printf("%d: %d\n", i, <-randStream)
}
```

The `fmt.Println` statement never gets run. A possible solution would be to provide the producer goroutine with a channel informing it to exit:

```
newRandStream := func(done <-chan interface{}) <-chan int { randStream := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        defer fmt.Println("newRandStream closure exited.")
        defer close(randStream)
        for {
            select {
            case randStream <- rand.Int():
            case <-done:
                return
            }
        }
    }()

    return randStream
}

done := make(chan interface{})
randStream := newRandStream(done)
fmt.Println("3 random ints:")
for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
    fmt.Printf("%d: %d\n", i, <-randStream)
}
close(done)

// Simulate ongoing work
time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
```

## The or-channel ##

Sometimes you want to combine one or more `done` channels into a single `done ` channel that closes if any of its component channels close. You can write a `select` statement that does this..if you know the number of `done` channels you're working with by runtime. 

```
var or func(channels ...<-chan interface{}) <-chan interface{}
or = func(channels ...<-chan interface{}) <-chan interface{} { 
    switch len(channels) {
    case 0: 
        return nil
    case 1: 
        return channels[0]
    }

    orDone := make(chan interface{})
    go func() { 
        defer close(orDone)

        switch len(channels) {
        case 2: 
            select {
            case <-channels[0]:
            case <-channels[1]:
            }
        default: 
            select {
            case <-channels[0]:
            case <-channels[1]:
            case <-channels[2]:
            case <-or(append(channels[3:], orDone)...): 
            }
        }
    }()
    return orDone
}
sig := func(after time.Duration) <-chan interface{} { 
    c := make(chan interface{})
    go func() {
        defer close(c)
        time.Sleep(after)
    }()
    return c
}

start := time.Now() 
<-or(
    sig(2*time.Hour),
    sig(5*time.Minute),
    sig(1*time.Second),
    sig(1*time.Hour),
    sig(1*time.Minute),
)
fmt.Printf("done after %v", time.Since(start)) 
```

This can be helpful especially at the intersection of modules in your system - where you have multiple conditions for cancelling trees of goroutines through the call stack.

## Error Handling ##

"Who should be responsible for handling the error?"

This rings true especially in concurrent processes with parent-sibling relationships. The complexity rises and we need to handle things in a logical manner. Like here:

```
type Result struct { 
    Error    error
    Response *http.Response
}

checkStatus := func(done <-chan interface{}, urls ...string) <-chan Result { 
    results := make(chan Result)
    go func() {
        defer close(results)

        for _, url := range urls {
            var result Result
            resp, err := http.Get(url)
            result = Result{Error: err, Response: resp} 
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            case results <- result: 
            }
        }
    }()
    return results
}

done := make(chan interface{})
defer close(done)

urls := []string{"https://www.google.com", "https://badhost"}
for result := range checkStatus(done, urls...) {
    // Another approach would be to introduce an errCount variable to keep track of 
    // how many errors you get and stop the loop after a specific number.
    if result.Error != nil { 
        fmt.Printf("error: %v", result.Error)
        continue
    }
    fmt.Printf("Response: %v\n", result.Response.Status)
}
```

Errors should be considered first-class citizens when constructing values to return from goroutines. Especially in more complex scenarios. Good ideas to have tight coupling with the results and use the same lines of communications..

## Pipelines ##

Pipeline is another tool to form abstractions in your system. It's a series of things that take the data, perform an operation on it and pass the data back out - these being called *pipeline stages*. 

Pipeline stages can process data through:

- Batch processing - operating on chunks of data at once.
- Stream processing - operating on one discrete value at a time.

```
// Batch processing.
multiply := func(values []int, multiplier int) []int {
    multipliedValues := make([]int, len(values))
    for i, v := range values {
        multipliedValues[i] = v * multiplier
    }
    return multipliedValues
}
add := func(values []int, additive int) []int {
    addedValues := make([]int, len(values))
    for i, v := range values {
        addedValues[i] = v + additive
    }
    return addedValues
}
ints := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
for _, v := range multiply(add(multiply(ints, 2), 1), 2) {
    fmt.Println(v)
}


// Stream processing.
multiply := func(value, multiplier int) int {
    return value * multiplier
}

add := func(value, additive int) int {
    return value + additive
}

ints := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
for _, v := range ints {
    fmt.Println(multiply(add(multiply(v, 2), 1), 2))
}

```
---

### Best practices for constructing pipelines ###

The example below encompasses most of the things we talked about in the previous chapters. For example to use the `done` channel in order to gracefully signal multiple channels to exit when we want to and prevent goroutine leaks.

```
generator := func(done <-chan interface{}, integers ...int) <-chan int {
    intStream := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        defer close(intStream)
        for _, i := range integers {
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            case intStream <- i:
            }
        }
    }()
    return intStream
}

multiply := func(
    done <-chan interface{},
    intStream <-chan int,
    multiplier int,
) <-chan int {
    multipliedStream := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        defer close(multipliedStream)
        for i := range intStream {
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            case multipliedStream <- i * multiplier:
            }
        }
    }()
    return multipliedStream
}

add := func(
    done <-chan interface{},
    intStream <-chan int,
    additive int,
) <-chan int {
    addedStream := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        defer close(addedStream)
        for i := range intStream {
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            case addedStream <- i + additive:
            }
        }
    }()
    return addedStream
}

done := make(chan interface{})
defer close(done)

intStream := generator(done, 1, 2, 3, 4)
pipeline := multiply(done, add(done, multiply(done, intStream, 2), 1), 2)

for v := range pipeline {
    fmt.Println(v)
}
```

Here, the `generator` function converts a discrete set of values into a stream of data on a channel. After all, that's why it's called a `generator`. Another key thing to note is that each stage of the pipeline is executing concurrently.

## Fan-Out, Fan-In ##

Computational intensive/ blocked stages in the pipeline can significantly increase the time it takes the program to complete. You can parallelize pulls from an upstream stage by using *fan-out, fan-in*. 

Fan-out - starting multiple goroutines to handle the input from a pipeline

Fan-in - combining said results into one channel. You essentially multiplex these stages by fanning-in.

---

This pattern is especially useful if:
- it doesn't rely on values that the stage has calculated before (i.e. order-independence)
- it takes a long time to run

We can use the previous example from pipelines and update it with some additional logic, construnctive a naive prime finder.

```
repeatFn := func(
    done <-chan interface{},
    fn func() interface{},
) <-chan interface{} {
    valueStream := make(chan interface{})
    go func() {
        defer close(valueStream)
        for {
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            case valueStream <- fn():
            }
        }
    }()
    return valueStream
}
take := func(
    done <-chan interface{},
    valueStream <-chan interface{},
    num int,
) <-chan interface{} {
    takeStream := make(chan interface{})
    go func() {
        defer close(takeStream)
        for i := 0; i < num; i++ {
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            case takeStream <- <-valueStream:
            }
        }
    }()
    return takeStream
}
toInt := func(done <-chan interface{}, valueStream <-chan interface{}) <-chan int {
    intStream := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        defer close(intStream)
        for v := range valueStream {
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            case intStream <- v.(int):
            }
        }
    }()
    return intStream
}
primeFinder := func(done <-chan interface{}, intStream <-chan int) <-chan interface{} {
    primeStream := make(chan interface{})
    go func() {
        defer close(primeStream)
        for integer := range intStream {
            integer -= 1
            prime := true
            for divisor := integer - 1; divisor > 1; divisor-- {
                if integer%divisor == 0 {
                    prime = false
                    break
                }
            }

            if prime {
                select {
                case <-done:
                    return
                case primeStream <- integer:
                }
            }
        }
    }()
    return primeStream
}
fanIn := func(
    done <-chan interface{},
    channels ...<-chan interface{},
) <-chan interface{} { 
    var wg sync.WaitGroup 
    multiplexedStream := make(chan interface{})

    multiplex := func(c <-chan interface{}) { 
        defer wg.Done()
        for i := range c {
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            case multiplexedStream <- i:
            }
        }
    }

    // Select from all the channels
    wg.Add(len(channels)) 
    for _, c := range channels {
        go multiplex(c)
    }

    // Wait for all the reads to complete
    go func() { 
        wg.Wait()
        close(multiplexedStream)
    }()

    return multiplexedStream
}

done := make(chan interface{})
defer close(done)

start := time.Now()

rand := func() interface{} { return rand.Intn(50000000) }

randIntStream := toInt(done, repeatFn(done, rand))

numFinders := runtime.NumCPU()
fmt.Printf("Spinning up %d prime finders.\n", numFinders)
finders := make([]<-chan interface{}, numFinders)
fmt.Println("Primes:")
for i := 0; i < numFinders; i++ {
    finders[i] = primeFinder(done, randIntStream)
}

for prime := range take(done, fanIn(done, finders...), 10) {
    fmt.Printf("\t%d\n", prime)
}

fmt.Printf("Search took: %v", time.Since(start))
```

## The or-done-channel ## 

This pattern is useful when you can't make assertions about how a channel will behave. Especially if you work with channels from disparate parts of your system - you don't always know if the fact that your goroutine was canceles means the channel you're reading from will be cancelled as well.

We can use `select` statements that also select from a `done` channel. 

```
// Instead of having this:
for val := range myChan {
    // Do something with val
}


// That will probably explode into this:
loop:
for {
    select {
    case <-done:
        break loop
    case maybeVal, ok := <-myChan:
        if ok == false {
            return // or maybe break from for
        }
        // Do something with val
    }
}
```

You can have:

```
orDone := func(done, c <-chan interface{}) <-chan interface{} {
    valStream := make(chan interface{})
    go func() {
        defer close(valStream)
        for {
            select {
            case <-done:
                return
            case v, ok := <-c:
                if ok == false {
                    return
                }
                select {
                case valStream <- v:
                case <-done:
                }
            }
        }
    }()
    return valStream
}

// So we can still have somthing like this:
for val := range orDone(done, myChan) {
    // Do something with val
}
```

## The tee-channel ## 

This is useful if you want to split values coming in from a channel and send them off into two separate areas in your codebase.

```
tee := func(
    done <-chan interface{},
    in <-chan interface{},
    ) (_, _ <-chan interface{}) { <-chan interface{}) {
    out1 := make(chan interface{})
    out2 := make(chan interface{})
    go func() {
        defer close(out2)
        for val := range orDone(done, in) {
            var out1, out2 = out1, out2
            for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
                select {
                case <-done:
                case out1<-val:
                    out1 = nil
                case out2<-val:
                    out2 = nil
                }
            }
        }
    }()
    return out1, out2
}

done := make(chan interface{})
defer close(done)

// Notice how out1 and out2 are tightly coupled.
out1, out2 := tee(done, take(done, repeat(done, 1, 2), 4))

for val1 := range out1 {
    fmt.Printf("out1: %v, out2: %v\n", val1, <-out2)
}
```
